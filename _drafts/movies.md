- once upon a time
- Start multiple stories..keep meandering and then come back to first and say that you forgot about it and 
- Probably start it as a cooking tutorial, keep adding a little move to other talks, add a little more to the dish, move away....and end punch line...I think I had my dinner in MacD

Story ideas:
- In house there are two people - one is a ghost but the ghost assume that he is not dead and does not believe in ghost while the other person is a normal person and he comes up with ideas about ghost. Two thoughts
	- The ghost keeps saying that the weird things happening in the house is not due to ghost and is some natural occurance. While the guys keeps saying that no it is due to the ghost. The house is probably a booby trap for some treasure and so has lot of gimmicks and jumpscares. The final twist is the guys atlast comes to know he has been talking to the ghost all along and the ghost gives the final jump scare while the whole stuff before it is not
	- the ghost all through goes through the jump scares all the while dismissing each and every aspect of it as a booby trap and slowy starts belienving that ghosts are possible until in the end he gets reminded that he was killed in one such booby trap and finds his deadbody...probably that is the highest form of jumpscare the point where he feels that he is going to meet the ghost he finds himself dead
	- Make the house a booby trap for a treasure or let the house be halloween house
- Can a ghost movie be made with first person immersive where the audience is a character

Story ideas:
===========
- A person wrties a story adn each chapter ends 
	- With him narating one episode and the next chapter is about the response for that story from people and how the book progress based on the feed back
- Two people meet each day on a bus
	- They keep sharing their life experiences to each other
	- How each form a opinion about each other based on these stories
	- How relationships ensue like talking about his girlfriend the girl assumes he may not like her etc
- A heist is planned. 
	- There is a driver who manages the car
	- The people getting in the car get in to kill the driver
	- The driver is assuming they are planning a heist but they heist is staged to kill the driver
	- The driver goes about the heist as a normal dad. Like taking about his family, to friends, like a matter of fact

- peter sellers pink panther style detective story
